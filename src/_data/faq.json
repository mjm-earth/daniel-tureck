      "question": "What genres do you work with?",
      "answer": "Primarily R&B, Hip-Hop, Soul and Pop - but I'm open to anything that moves me. If the music is intentional and the artist is serious about releasing it properly, we're probably a good fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work remotely?",
      "answer": "Yes. Most of my mixing work is done remotely from Robot Slap Studios. You send files, we talk through the vision and I deliver a mix that sounds the way you always heard it in your head."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started?",
      "answer": "Reach out through the contact form or send me an email. Tell me a bit about your project - the artist name, how many songs and a link to rough mixes or demos. From there we'll hop on a call to talk through the vision and make sure it's a good fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the typical turnaround?",
      "answer": "It depends on the project scope and my current schedule. Once we agree on the timeline, I'll give you a clear delivery window. I don't rush - every mix gets the attention it deserves."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a mix cost?",
      "answer": "Pricing depends on the scope - number of songs, complexity and timeline. This is real craft, not a bargain service. Reach out and we'll put together something that works for your project."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from me to start mixing?",
      "answer": "Consolidated stems (WAV or AIFF), a rough mix for reference and any notes on the direction you're going for. The more context the better - references, mood, what you love about the song already."
